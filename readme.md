# Socket.io chat in webpack-typescript

### Tech Stack

This project has taken the **ReactJS** as development framework.

- **Apollo-boost**, for local management.
- **Emotion** for styled the application.

Actually, it is build on top of typescript with a minimal webpack configuration.

Additionaly, for the folder structure I based on _[Atomic webdesign](https://bradfrost.com/blog/post/atomic-web-design/)_.

### Project Development

##### For the localmanagement

The desition of working with **Apollo-boost** was made due to the project initial was made on _**GATSBY**_.
But then I change it to a completly scratch webpack project.

Because I have worked with both _Apollo_ and _Redux_. I decided _Apollo-Boost_ due to I feel it much simple than all the redux life cycle.

##### Visual Components

After choosing the stack, the next step was to have everything mock.
On this behalf emotion was choosen for library as styled components. On the past I had worked with css, sass and pther pre-css compilers. Eventough is okay to work with them. Styled components encapsulates much better the styles between components. This is the main reason of choosing this style system.
